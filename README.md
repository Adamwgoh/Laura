This is a group project (G52GRP) with 4 group members during my Year 2 studies.
This is an reupload as a mess up had me deleting the repo by mistake during the summer(oops!)

This project is built by :  Ho Swee Jim
                            Adam Weisen Goh
                            Dominic Coopoosamy
                            Jamila Abdulsalam
                            Osman Abdel Nasir
  
  
This project involves detecting a vehicle turning to the wrong direction of the road, which only allows a one way traffic around the campus,
captures a screenshot, and detects its plate number. The System then traces an internal database for registered plate number and issues an email
to the related traffic offender.

This project contains online datasets and photos of carplates taken during the development of project. No copyright infringement, nor privacy infringement are intended.
all car plate numbers will be taken down as soon as possible.

List below shows things that did not work and could be improved. 
The system had not been tested under different light conditions, neither real time tests.


THINGS NOT WORKING : 

SVM Classification not accurate. 
Video stream GUI not working
Plate cannot be detected directly from video screenshot due to low resolution and algorithm incompetence.
Histogram analysis may not be the best way to do in this case.
